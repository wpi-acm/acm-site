<h4>History</h4>
<p>ACM established student chapters to provide an opportunity for students to
play a more active role in the Association and its professional activities. By
encouraging organization of student chapters on college and university campuses,
the Association is able to introduce students to the benefits of professional
organization. These benefits include regular meetings that encourage and enhance
learning through exchange of ideas among students as well as between established
professionals and students. Members of a student chapter may also take advantage
of the activities and services provided by ACM, including the lectureship
program, student programming and tutorial contests, and the publications
program. Student chapters provide an obvious setting for the development and
demonstration of leadership capabilities. Finally, students find the various
activities of ACM and its student chapters both professionally and socially
exciting as well as rewarding.</p>

<p>Initially, the ACM organizational structure was based solely on individual
membership. In 1954, as a result of growth and the wishes of its members,
chapters were officially formed. These chapters provided a means for people in a
geographical area with a common interest in computing to exchange ideas and
sponsor professional activities. Since the recognition of the Dallas-Fort Worth
Chapter in 1954 as the first ACM chapter, the number of professional chapters
has grown steadily to over 113 today, and they have become an integral part of
the ACM organization. Student chapters were authorized by the ACM in 1961; the
first was chartered at the University of Southwestern Louisiana.</p>

<p>Student chapters provide important services to ACM student members and offer
a means whereby the ACM can provide scientific information on the industry to
other members of the college or university community as well as to the general
public. Moreover, professional chapters and student chapters are focal points
for feedback from members to the ACM leadership. Finally, ACM Chapters are a
training ground for the Association’s future leaders. Over one-third of the
current members of the ACM Council began their volunteer work with ACM as
officers in the chapter system.</p>
